# One Star Scraper
Author: Evan Collins

This script scrapes one star book titles from http://books.toscrape.com/.
It grabs the books from the first 5 pages, then selects the lowest rated books, the ones with only one star ratings. 
The titles of the one star rated books are then printed out.
The script starts by accesssing the url, and parsing the text. Then the books, and ratings are selected and sorted through.
The output is a printed list of all the book titles which have one star ratings.
